# Client request submission

A Client may decide to either: \
\
a) create a custom CaaS request or; \
b) select from options advertised in the CaaS portal.\
\
The latter is for mainly illustrative purposes, to demonstrate the diversity of choice and to demonstrate the standard structure of operations.

Once a Client has had their request reviewed and accepted by the Community Working Group, they will be invited to stake and lock the required payment in $USDC tokens. This is held in escrow until the task is completed by the Working Group.&#x20;

Upon completion of the task, the Client is required to release the escrow to the Working Group so that payments can be distributed.

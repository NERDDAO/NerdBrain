# Feedback and Arbitration

For the benefit of the Client, and the project itself, feedback is incredibly important. Each time a CaaS task has been fulfilled, the Client is invited to fill out a feedback form to help us evaluate the process.

If a Client is dissatisfied with the service they have received, they are entitled to enter into an Arbitration process with DeSciWorld DAO. The result of the Arbitration process will determine whether the CaaS payment is returned partially or in full to the Client, or if it is released to the Working Group to be distributed amongst the Contributors.

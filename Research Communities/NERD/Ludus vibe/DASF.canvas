For example, before transferring tokens or assets, checks can ensure that the sender has enough balance and that the receiver is a valid address. Also, checking the result of external calls to other contracts will prevent failures from halting and reverting your contract's execution.\n\nThese suggestions aim to improve efficiency, reduce cost, and maintain the secure operation of the Ludus Social Graph contract.","x":-3540,"y":-15760,"width":880,"height":318,"color":"6"},

Match Result Submission:\n   - Athletes submit their match results through the `publishMatchResult` function in the LudusSocialGraph contract.\n   - Match details, including participant addresses, scores, and other relevant information, are securely stored within the `pendingMatchResults` mapping.\n\n2. Match Result Validation:\n   - A designated validator, either a third-party user or an automated software solution, verifies the submitted match result for accuracy and fairness.\n   - The validator accesses the pending match details and reviews the information provided.\n\n3. Approval of Match Result:\n   - If the match result meets the validation criteria, the validator invokes the `approveMatchResult` function, passing the unique identifier of the pending match as an argument.\n   - Only the designated validator is allowed to call this function within the LudusSocialGraph contract.\n   - The contract validates that the match result has been approved by setting the `isScoreValidated` field within the respective athlete's `Athlete` struct to indicate validation.\n\n4.

		{"chat_role":"assistant","id":"f7dd2dc9f7265abc","type":"text","text":"Here's a breakdown of how the integrated architecture of the LudusSocialGraph, match result validation, and Ludus ERC20 token works:\n\n## LudusSocialGraph and Match Result Validation\n\n- The 'LudusSocialGraph' contract is a Solidity smart contract that represents a social graph for athletes in the Ludus sports platform.\n- It includes functionalities for athlete registration, following other athletes, tracking follower counts, and storing match results.\n- The contract has been enhanced to include match result validation by a designated validator.\n- A validator visually validates the match score or through automated software.\n- To ensure validation, a new field named 'isScoreValidated' is introduced in the 'Athlete' struct to track whether a match's score has been validated.\n- A mapping named 'pendingMatchResults' is created to store match results awaiting validation.\n- Once the match score is validated, it can be published to the 'matchResults' mapping within the 'LudusSocialGraph' contract.\n\n## Ludus ERC20 Token Integration\n\n- The Ludus ERC20 token contract is deployed as a separate contract or connected to an existing ERC20 contract.\n- The token is named 'Ludus' and represents a digital currency within the Ludus sports platform.\n- It supports token minting and distribution features.\n\n## Match Result Reporting and Token Minting\n\n1. Athlete publishes the match result:\n   - An athlete registers the match result using the 'publishMatchResult' function in the LudusSocialGraph contract.\n   - The match data, including participants and scores, is securely stored in the 'pendingMatchResults' mapping for validation.\n\n2. Validator approves the match result:\n   - A designated validator, either a third-party user or a software solution, verifies the match result and approves it.\n   - The validator calls the 'approveMatchResult' function, providing the unique identifier of the pending match as an argument.\n   - The 'isScoreValidated' field is updated in the 'Athlete' struct to indicate the approved validation status.\n\n3. Token minting and distribution:\n   - Once the match result is approved and validated, the contract triggers the minting of Ludus tokens.\n   - The token minting process creates new Ludus tokens in proportion to the importance or nature of the match result.\n   - The tokens are minted for the winners or participants based on the match outcome and their Elo ratings.\n   - Distribution of tokens is executed, with rewards varying based on the match importance and performance.\n\n4. Token transfer and balance:\n   - Athletes can transfer their Ludus tokens using the ERC20 token transfer functionality.\n   - The 'Athlete' struct includes a 'tokenBalance' field to represent the number of Ludus tokens held by each athlete.\n\nThe integrated architecture provides an ecosystem where athletes can publish match results to the LudusSocialGraph after receiving validation from a designated validator. The approved match results trigger the minting of Ludus tokens that are distributed to participants based on their match performance. The Ludus tokens can then be transferred and held as balances by the athletes, establishing a digital currency within the Ludus sports platform.","x":-640,"y":-9480,"width":1200,"height":1080,"color":"6"},

It leverages the concept of a social graph to map relationships between various sports personalities, in this case, athletes. This mapping represents a clear social relationship of followership amongst athletes.\n\nThe main contract, LudusSocialGraph, is designed around key features of a social graph. It provides functionalities such as athlete profiles registration, tracking of athletes following each other, querying follower count and checking if an athlete is following another.\n\nThe contract defines an Athlete as a Struct with properties name, profileUrl, totalFollowers, and followers for comprehensive collection and management of athlete data. A mapping serves as a data store associating each Athlete's profile with their Ethereum address.\n\nA developer can initiate relationships (or follow) between athletes via the `lensFollowAthlete` function, and total followers are tracked using a simple integer counter that increments each time an athlete is followed.\n\nTo allow queries on this social graph and access stored data, various view functions are implemented. There's `lensGetFollowerCount` to get the count of followers of an athlete and `lensIsFollowing` to check if a specific athlete is following another. Lastly, `lensGetAthlete` function provides comprehensive data for a specific athlete.\n\nLudusSocialGraph is designed to integrate seamlessly with other applications. For instance, applications that track match results can interact with the social graph, using performance results to trigger actions within the contract or using athlete profile information to create enriched user experiences.\n\nExpert developers will appreciate that the smart contract, while high in functionality, remains flexible in design, ensuring potential for customization and integration making it an ideal fit for decentralized sports applications.\n","x":-660,"y":-5740,"width":1160,"height":833,"color":"6"},

Open a text editor and create a new file called `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Copy the following content into the `docker-compose.yml` file:\n\n   ```yaml\n   version: '3.3'\n   networks:\n     traefik:\n       external: true\n   services:\n     mongodb:\n       container_name: backend\n       image: mongo:latest\n       restart: always\n       volumes:\n         - /data/mongo/docker:/data/db\n       networks:\n         - traefik\n       ports:\n         - 27017:27017\n       environment:\n         MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: ludus\n         MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: docker.2019.ludus\n   ```\n   \n5. Save the `docker-compose.yml` file.\n6. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is saved.\n7. Run the following command to start the MongoDB container:\n\n   ```shell\n   docker-compose up -d mongodb\n   ```\n\n   This will download the MongoDB image and start the container with the specified configurations.\n8. Wait for the MongoDB container to start. You can check the logs to track the progress:\n\n   ```shell\n   docker logs -f backend\n   ```\n\n   Press `Ctrl + C` to exit the logs view.\n9. You can now connect to the MongoDB instance using the following connection string:\n\n   ```\n   mongodb://ludus:docker.2019.ludus@localhost:27017\n   ```\n\n   Use the specified username (`ludus`) and password (`docker.2019.ludus`) to connect.\n\nThat's it!

No form of harassment, bullying, or discrimination will be tolerated.\n\n- Equality: Everyone should be treated equally, regardless of their gender, race, age, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.\n\n- Sportsmanship: Participants should accept both victories and losses with grace and humility. Acts of bad sportsmanship, like gloating or tantrum-throwing, are not acceptable.\n\nExemplifying these principles in action:\n\n- Disciplinary Actions: A clear protocol for incidents violating these principles should be exercised. For instance, a three-strike rule could be implemented, where users are first warned, then temporarily banned, and ultimately permanently excluded from the Ludus platform if infractions persist.\n\n- Reporting Mechanism: There should be a system through which instances of unethical behavior can be reported by any user of the platform, and these reports should be seriously investigated by the platform's administration.\n\n- User Education: Ethical guidelines should be clearly communicated to all users during the onboarding process, and reminders or educational materials may be periodically disseminated to ensure ongoing adherence.\n\n- Enforcement: Active monitoring should be conducted to detect and prevent any breaches.

He expresses the need for a salary structure in tennis to provide a stable income. Rubin talks about his own sponsorship deals and the challenges faced by players in terms of expenses for travel, accommodations, coaching, and meals. He emphasizes the importance of ranking points in tournaments and the limited opportunities for lower-ranked players to earn points and prize money. Rubin suggests that the sport hasn't kept pace with others in terms of income generation and player protections.

No form of harassment, bullying, or discrimination will be tolerated.\n\n- Equality: Everyone should be treated equally, regardless of their gender, race, age, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.\n\n- Sportsmanship: Participants should accept both victories and losses with grace and humility. Acts of bad sportsmanship, like gloating or tantrum-throwing, are not acceptable.\n\nExemplifying these principles in action:\n\n- Disciplinary Actions: A clear protocol for incidents violating these principles should be exercised. For instance, a three-strike rule could be implemented, where users are first warned, then temporarily banned, and ultimately permanently excluded from the Ludus platform if infractions persist.\n\n- Reporting Mechanism: There should be a system through which instances of unethical behavior can be reported by any user of the platform, and these reports should be seriously investigated by the platform's administration.\n\n- User Education: Ethical guidelines should be clearly communicated to all users during the onboarding process, and reminders or educational materials may be periodically disseminated to ensure ongoing adherence.\n\n- Enforcement: Active monitoring should be conducted to detect and prevent any breaches. Compliance can be ensured by using algorithms on the Ludus platform to detect and alert administrators to any abnormal activities suggesting foul play, not dissimilar from anti-cheating measures in traditional physical sports and eSports.","id":"fd2f5a2f3894b160","x":-6540,"y":7489,"width":420,"height":1287,"color":"6"},

Decisions should be communicated clearly and swiftly to all involved parties.\n\n- Implementation of Verdicts: Post-decision, appropriate action should be taken depending on the severity of the violation. Penalties might range from temporary or permanent suspension of the offending participant, reversal of game results, or other sanctions as deemed fit by the mediators.\n\n- Appeals Process: An appeal system should be available for those who are dissatisfied with the dispute resolution outcome, ensuring a secondary review of the dispute by another group of mediators.\n\n- Transparency: Throughout the process, transparency should be maintained. However, it must balance the need to preserve the privacy of those involved in the dispute.

For a new follower, define an event `NewFollower` that takes the Ethereum addresses of the follower and the followed.\n- Emit these events inside the functions that correspond to these actions. In the new registration function, after successfully registering the new user, emit a `NewRegistration` event with the registrant's Ethereum address. In the follow function, after successfully following another user, emit a `NewFollower` event with the Ethereum addresses of the follower and the followed.\n- These events will be logged on the blockchain, creating a transparent and immutable history of actions.

These are set as contract state variables.\n\n2. **Athlete Registration**\n   - Athletes register using the `registerAthlete` function. Athlete details and ERC721 token id are required. This function checks if the athlete is already registered and if not, athlete details are added to a mapping structure, using the athlete's address as the key. \n   - Athlete's ERC721 token is transferred from the athlete to the LudusSocialGraph contract by the `transferFrom` function of the IERC721 interface, linking the athlete with their ERC721 token.\n   - LudusSocialGraph contract mints 100 Ludus Tokens through the `mint` function of the LudusToken contract, and sends these tokens to the athlete.\n\n3. **Athlete Following**\n   - Users can follow an athlete through the `followAthlete` function. \n   - The function checks if the athlete exists and if the user already follows the athlete. On successful verification, the user is added to the athlete's followers list.\n   - The `getFollowerCount` function returns the total followers for each athlete. The `isFollowing` function checks if a user follows a certain athlete.\n\n4. **Match Result Submission and Validation**\n   - Athletes submit matches through `publishMatchResult` function. The submitted match resides under pending validation.\n   - A third-party validator validates the match result and calls `validateMatchResult`, confirming the match result and converting pending validation status to validated.\n   - The validated match result triggers minting 100 new Ludus tokens through the `mint` function.\n\nIn summary, these smart contracts form an interdependent ecosystem where athlete registration, match result submission and validation, and token minting and distribution functionalities are all connected and measurable. This leads to a self-sustaining, incentivized, and engaging sporting platform.","x":8590,"y":-9880,"width":2850,"height":640,"color":"6"},

		{"chat_role":"assistant","id":"6f06d13c76f903ab","type":"text","text":"To implement the functionality of allowing users to search and select athletes to invite for a match, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a list that will store the selected athletes' information.\n\n   ```dart\n   List selectedAthletes = [];\n   ```\n\n2. Design a UI component that displays the athlete's ranking information and includes an \"Add\" button or icon. Let's call this component `RankingInfo`.\n\n   For example:\n   ```dart\n   RankingInfo(\n     athleteName: 'John Doe',\n     sport: 'Tennis',\n     league: 'Amateur League',\n     eloRating: 1500,\n     onAdd: () {\n       // Add the athlete to the selectedAthletes list\n       selectedAthletes.add({\n         'name': 'John Doe',\n         'sport': 'Tennis',\n         'league': 'Amateur League',\n         'eloRating': 1500,\n       });\n     },\n   );\n   ```\n\n3. Implement a search functionality to filter athletes based on user input. You can use a search bar widget and specify the filter criteria in the backend API call.\n\n   For example:\n   ```dart\n   TextField(\n     onChanged: (value) {\n       // Perform the search operation using value as the search query\n       // Update the athleteList with the filtered results\n     },\n   );\n   ```\n\n4. Display the search results by dynamically rendering the `RankingInfo` widget for each athlete in the filtered list.\n\n   For example:\n   ```dart\n   ListView.builder(\n     itemCount: filteredAthletes.length,\n     itemBuilder: (context, index) {\n       return RankingInfo(\n         athleteName: filteredAthletes[index]['name'],\n         sport: filteredAthletes[index]['sport'],\n         league: filteredAthletes[index]['league'],\n         eloRating: filteredAthletes[index]['eloRating'],\n         onAdd: () {\n           // Add the athlete to the selectedAthletes list\n           selectedAthletes.add(filteredAthletes[index]);\n         },\n       );\n     },\n   );\n   ```\n\n5. Allow users to remove athletes from the selectedAthletes list, if needed. For example, you can include a remove button in the `RankingInfo` component and handle its functionality accordingly.\n\n   ```dart\n   RankingInfo(\n     athleteName: selectedAthletes[index]['name'],\n     sport: selectedAthletes[index]['sport'],\n     league: selectedAthletes[index]['league'],\n     eloRating: selectedAthletes[index]['eloRating'],\n     onRemove: () {\n       // Remove the athlete from the selectedAthletes list\n       selectedAthletes.removeAt(index);\n     },\n   );\n   ```\n\n6.

		{"chat_role":"assistant","id":"bb9aa8bcba5d3cad","type":"text","text":"To display the value \"Public\" when the `matchType` app state variable is set to `true`, you can use conditional rendering in FlutterFlow. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Select the text widget where you want to display the match type (e.g., \"Public\" or \"Private\").\n2. In the properties panel on the right, look for the \"Content\" section.\n3. Click on the \"+\" button next to the \"Text\" field to add a new expression.\n4. In the expression editor, write a conditional statement that checks the value of the `matchType` app state variable.\n\n   For example, if you want to display \"Public\" when `matchType` is `true` and \"Private\" otherwise, you can use the following expression:\n   ```\n   {{ matchType ? 'Public' : 'Private' }}\n   ```\n\n   This expression uses a ternary operator (`? : `) to check the value of `matchType` and return either 'Public' or 'Private' accordingly.\n\n5. Save your changes, and the text widget will now display \"Public\" when the `matchType` app state variable is `true` and \"Private\" when it's `false`.\n\nBy using conditional rendering with expressions in FlutterFlow, you can dynamically display different text based on the value of app state variables like `matchType`.","x":11380,"y":-6600,"width":754,"height":600,"color":"6"},

Specifically, you want the user to select various options for match creation, such as match type (public or private), number of players (singles or doubles), if it affects ELO, the date and time, and the venue. However, when trying to update the document in the Firebase backend with this information, you are unable to select the updated variable from the local app state in FlutterFlow.\n\nThe problem you are facing might be related to how you are handling the local app state in FlutterFlow. Here are a few potential solutions to consider:\n\n1. Ensure that you have properly defined and initialized the app state variables in FlutterFlow. Double-check the variable names, data types, and default values.\n\n2. Make sure that you are correctly updating the app state variables as the user selects different options. Check if the switches or other UI elements are correctly updating the corresponding app state variables.\n\n3. Verify that you are using the correct app state variables when sending the data to the backend. Check the variable names and ensure that you are referring to the updated values.\n\n4. If you are using any custom functions or logic in FlutterFlow to handle the backend call, review the code to ensure that you are correctly referencing the app state variables when making the request.\n\n5. Consider adding debug statements or breakpoints in your code to help identify where the issue might be occurring. This can help you pinpoint the specific point of failure.\n\nBy reviewing these aspects and making any necessary adjustments, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully update the backend call with the selected match creation options.","x":9220,"y":-5280,"width":960,"height":864,"color":"6"},

Let's go into more detail about step 1 and provide some examples.\n\nTo ensure that you have properly defined and initialized the app state variables in FlutterFlow, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open your FlutterFlow project and navigate to the screen where you are handling the match creation options.\n\n2. In the left sidebar, you should see the \"Data\" tab. Click on it to access the app state variables.\n\n3. Click on the \"+ Add Variable\" button to create a new app state variable. Give it a meaningful name, set the appropriate data type (e.g., boolean for switches, string for text inputs), and provide a default value that matches the initial state of the option.\n\n   For example, you can create the following app state variables:\n   - matchType: boolean, default value: false (for private)\n   - numberOfPlayers: string, default value: \"Singles\"\n   - affectsElo: boolean, default value: false\n   - dateTime: string, default value: \"\" (empty string)\n   - venue: string, default value: \"\" (empty string)\n\n4. Once you have created the app state variables, you can use them throughout your screen to bind UI elements to their values.\n\n   For example, you can bind the switch for match type to the `matchType` app state variable. When the switch is on, `matchType` will be true (for public) and when it's off, `matchType` will be false (for private).\n\n5. To update the app state variable with the selected option, you need to use the appropriate event or trigger. For switches, you can use the `On Toggle` event, and for other UI elements, you might use the `On Change` or `On Tap` events.\n\n   For example, when the user toggles the switch for match type, you can add an action to update the `matchType` app state variable based on the switch's value.\n\n   Here's a pseudo-code example to illustrate how you can update the app state variables in FlutterFlow:\n\n   ```dart\n   OnToggle(matchTypeSwitch) {\n     if (matchTypeSwitch.value) {\n       matchType = true;  // Update the app state variable\n     } else {\n       matchType = false;\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\nBy properly defining and initializing the app state variables in FlutterFlow, and correctly updating them based on user actions, you can ensure that the variables hold the selected match creation options.

Athlete publishes the match result:\n   - An athlete registers the match result using the 'publishMatchResult' function in the LudusSocialGraph contract.\n   - The match data, including participants and scores, is securely stored in the 'pendingMatchResults' mapping for validation.\n\n2. Validator approves the match result:\n   - A designated validator, either a third-party user or a software solution, verifies the match result and approves it.\n   - The validator calls the 'approveMatchResult' function, providing the unique identifier of the pending match as an argument.\n   - The 'isScoreValidated' field is updated in the 'Athlete' struct to indicate the approved validation status.\n\n3. Token minting and distribution:\n   - Once the match result is approved and validated, the contract triggers the minting of Ludus tokens.\n   - The token minting process creates new Ludus tokens in proportion to the importance or nature of the match result.\n   - The tokens are minted for the winners or participants based on the match outcome and their Elo ratings.\n   - Distribution of tokens is executed, with rewards varying based on the match importance and performance.\n\n4. Token transfer and balance:\n   - Athletes can transfer their Ludus tokens using the ERC20 token transfer functionality.\n   - The 'Athlete' struct includes a 'tokenBalance' field to represent the number of Ludus tokens held by each athlete.\n\nThe integrated architecture provides an ecosystem where athletes can publish match results to the LudusSocialGraph after receiving validation from a designated validator. The approved match results trigger the minting of Ludus tokens that are distributed to participants based on their match performance. The Ludus tokens can then be transferred and held as balances by the athletes, establishing a digital currency within the Ludus sports platform.","x":-260,"y":-10226,"width":1200,"height":1080,"color":"6"},

Create a token contract or utilize an existing ERC20 token contract:\n   - Deploy a token contract or connect to an existing one that supports token minting and distribution.\n\n4. Integrate token minting and distribution:\n   - Modify the `publishMatchResult` function to calculate the token distribution based on the result and Elo ratings.\n   - Mint tokens to the winners based on the token distribution calculation.\n   - Distribute tokens to all participants, including the match winners and losers.\n\n5.

The `LudusSocialGraph` contract maintains a mapping called `athletes` that links Ethereum addresses to `Athlete` structs. The struct includes properties like `name`, `profileUrl`, `totalFollowers`, and an array to store addresses of followers.\n\n2. The contract has a constructor that accepts the address of the `LudusToken` contract. It creates an instance of `LudusToken` to facilitate token minting.\n\n3. The `registerAthlete` function allows athletes to register by providing their name and profile URL. It checks if the athlete is already registered and mints 100 Ludus tokens for the newly registered athlete.\n\n4. The `followAthlete` function enables athletes to follow each other. It checks if the athlete being followed exists and updates the follower count and followers' list.\n\n5. The `getFollowerCount` function returns the total number of followers for a given athlete.\n\n6. The `isFollowing` function checks if a given address is following another athlete.\n\nThe LudusSocialGraph contract enables athlete registration, following of other athletes, tracking of follower count, and checking the follower relationship. It also integrates with the LudusToken contract to facilitate token minting for registered athletes.","x":-2060,"y":-12506,"width":1392,"height":1609,"color":"6"},

It leverages the concept of a social graph to map relationships between various sports personalities, in this case, athletes. This mapping represents a clear social relationship of followership amongst athletes.\n\nThe main contract, LudusSocialGraph, is designed around key features of a social graph. It provides functionalities such as athlete profiles registration, tracking of athletes following each other, querying follower count and checking if an athlete is following another.\n\nThe contract defines an Athlete as a Struct with properties name, profileUrl, totalFollowers, and followers for comprehensive collection and management of athlete data. A mapping serves as a data store associating each Athlete's profile with their Ethereum address.\n\nA developer can initiate relationships (or follow) between athletes via the `lensFollowAthlete` function, and total followers are tracked using a simple integer counter that increments each time an athlete is followed.\n\nTo allow queries on this social graph and access stored data, various view functions are implemented. There's `lensGetFollowerCount` to get the count of followers of an athlete and `lensIsFollowing` to check if a specific athlete is following another. Lastly, `lensGetAthlete` function provides comprehensive data for a specific athlete.\n\nLudusSocialGraph is designed to integrate seamlessly with other applications. For instance, applications that track match results can interact with the social graph, using performance results to trigger actions within the contract or using athlete profile information to create enriched user experiences.\n\nExpert developers will appreciate that the smart contract, while high in functionality, remains flexible in design, ensuring potential for customization and integration making it an ideal fit for decentralized sports applications.\n","x":-280,"y":-6486,"width":1160,"height":833,"color":"6"},

Identify the components that require dynamic behavior, such as dropdown menus or text input fields.\n\n2. Determine the different types of data that will be used in these components, such as milk options, types of sugar, or espresso shot quantities.\n\n3. In the FlutterFlow interface, access the widget state of the dropdown components. Note that the widget state allows you to access and modify the internal state of the component.\n\n4. Customize the styling of the dropdown components to match your design preferences.\n\n5. Use the available options within the text input component to handle validation. For example, you can change the styling, like adding a red border, when the user's input does not meet the validation rules.\n\n6. Identify if there are any variables that are specific to a particular page or component and do not need to be accessed globally.\n\n7. If you have variables that are only used on a specific page, consider using page state variables. These variables will be accessible only on the page in which they are defined.\n\n8. In FlutterFlow, find the corresponding page where the variable is used. Look for the 'State Management' icon within the main root widget of the page.\n\n9. Click on the 'State Management' icon and add a new field, specifying the name of the page state variable and its type, such as an integer or string. Set an initial value if necessary.\n\n10. Replace any references to the old app state variable with the newly created page state variable.\n\n11. Delete the old app state variable if it is no longer used.\n\n12. Consider creating a model class and a widget class to separate the pages and widgets into two distinct structures. This organization enhances the accessibility and readability of your code.\n\n13. In the code view of FlutterFlow, utilize the new tab available to toggle between rendering the widget code and the model code. Choose the relevant code snippet to be copied when needed.\n\n14. If you have any questions about the state management upgrades or need further assistance, reach out to the FlutterFlow support team or the FlutterFlow community.\n\n15.

This error can occur due to a few different reasons. Here are some troubleshooting steps to try:\n\n1. Ensure that Docker is running: Check if the Docker application is running and active on your machine. If it is not running, start Docker and try running the `docker-compose` command again.\n\n2. Verify Docker installation: Make sure Docker is properly installed on your machine. You can confirm this by running the `docker version` command. If it provides the version information without any errors, then Docker is installed correctly.\n\n3. Check Docker daemon status: Verify the status of the Docker daemon by running the following command:\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo systemctl status docker\n   ```\n\n   If the Docker daemon is not active or running into any issues, you may need to start or restart it using appropriate commands depending on your operating system.\n\n4. Check Docker socket permissions: Ensure that your user has the necessary permissions to access the Docker daemon socket. The Docker daemon socket is typically located at `/var/run/docker.sock`. You can check the permissions of the socket file by running the following command:\n\n   ```shell\n   ls -l /var/run/docker.sock\n   ```\n\n   The output of this command should show the permissions for the Docker socket. Make sure your user has read and write permissions for the socket file. You may need to adjust the permissions using `chmod` if necessary.\n\n5. Run Docker commands with sudo: If you are running the Docker command without administrative privileges, try prefixing the commands with `sudo`. For example:\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo docker-compose up -d mongodb\n   ```\n\n   Running the command with `sudo` ensures that you have the necessary permissions to access the Docker daemon.\n\nTry these troubleshooting steps to resolve the \"Cannot connect to the Docker daemon\" error.

Match Result Submission and Validation:\n   - A new function named `submitMatchResult` is added in the contract. \n   - Registered athletes can submit matches using this function. The submitted match is initially stored under pending validation.\n   - A third-party validator, either a person or automated software, validates this stored match result.\n   - Upon validation, the third-party validator calls another function called `validateMatchResult` which confirms the match result and moves it from pending to validated status.\n\n2. Token Minting Upon Validation:\n   - Once the match result is validated, token minting is triggered. \n   - The `validateMatchResult` function calls the `mint` function of the LudusToken contract to mint 100 new tokens.\n\n3. Token Distribution: \n   - The newly minted tokens are then distributed among various participants. \n   - The distribution might follow a similar pattern to the initial registration token distribution, but it could also include other participants such as validators, referees, hosts, etc.\n   - The actual distribution percentage can be adjusted according to the roles, responsibilities, and rules of the platform.\n\nThe architecture encourages active participation from various roles while ensuring match results are valid and fair. It also maintains a mechanism to award participants with tokens for every validated match, fostering a competitive and engaging sporting platform.\n\nThese functionalities represent an ecosystem where sports matches are not only played, but also validated and rewarded with tokens. This makes it exciting for athletes, validators and other participants like referees and hosts. It also demonstrates a novel application of smart contracts within the field of competitive sporting platforms, reinforcing the potential of blockchain in revolutionizing various sectors.","x":9259,"y":-12969,"width":1460,"height":580,"color":"6"},

These are set as the contract state variables. \n- Athletes can register on the platform. During registration, the `registerAthlete` function is called where the athlete's details and their corresponding ERC721 token id are required. The function checks whether an athlete has already been registered. If not, it sets the athlete's details in a mapping structure of athletes, where the address of the athlete is the key. \n- The athlete's corresponding ERC721 token is transferred from the athlete to the LudusSocialGraph contract. This is done using the `transferFrom` function of the IERC721 interface. This links the athlete with their ERC721 token.\n- The LudusSocialGraph contract then mints 100 Ludus Tokens using the `mint` function of the LudusToken contract, and sends it to the athlete.\n- Users of the platform can follow an athlete by calling the `followAthlete` function. This function checks whether the athlete exists in the registry mapping, and if they don't follow the athlete already. If both check out, the user is added to the followers list of that athlete. \n- Individual counts of total followers for each athlete can be obtained using the `getFollowerCount` function. \n- A check can be performed to see if a user is following a certain athlete, through the `isFollowing` function.","x":9187,"y":-14149,"width":1507,"height":663,"color":"6"},

Here's a suggested token distribution table that incorporates these participants:\n\n| Participants         | Winner (%) | Runner-Up (%) | Participant(s) (%) | Referees (%) | Security (%) | Hosts (%) |\n|----------------------|------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|\n| 2                    | 50         | 25            | 5                  | 10           | 5             | 5         |\n| 3                    | 50         | 25            | 5                  | 5            | 5             | 5         |\n| 4                    | 50         | 25            | 5                  | 5            | 5             | 5         |\n\n\nIn this updated table, additional distribution percentages are allocated to the referees, security personnel, and hosts to acknowledge their role and contribution to the match. The winner and runner-up percentages remain the same as before.\n\nAs an expert coordinator, it is recommended to consider the following points while determining the distribution percentages:\n\n1. Fairness: Ensure that the token distribution reflects the level of involvement and importance of each participant category. Consider their impact on the successful execution of the match and the overall experience of the participants.\n\n2. Flexibility: The suggested percentages can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of each sports federation or organization. Consider the scale of the event, the number of participants, and the resources required by each participant category.\n\n3. Collaboration and Feedback: Engage with the stakeholders, including referees, security personnel, and hosts, to gather their input and feedback on the distribution percentages. This helps ensure a transparent and inclusive decision-making process.\n\nIt's important to note that the provided token distribution table is a suggested starting point. Depending on the specific dynamics and goals of the sports federation, it is recommended to have further discussions and consultations to fine-tune the token distribution percentages for each participant category.","x":365,"y":-14900,"width":1277,"height":592,"color":"6"},

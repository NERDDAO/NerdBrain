Once upon a time, in a distant digital universe, countless adventurers thrived. They faced endless battles and overcame numerous dangers until they each met their inevitable end. Just like in our reality, death is irreversible. However, the actions of these heroes leave lasting marks that resonate beyond their lifespan and reverberate throughout the Multiverse.

Enter Memento Mori 

MementoMori is an onChain memorial to fallen hardcore adventurers which records each adventurers' gear, their name, race and level at their time of death and stores it on chain for use throughout the Metaverse. Stats, images, and other functionality are intentionally omitted for others to interpret. Feel free to use MementoMori in any way you want.

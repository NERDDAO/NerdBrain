To turn [[Onchain Driving Permits]] into a hyperstructure for worldwide driving permits, we can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Standardized Format**: The first step would be to create a standardized format for the Onchain Driving Permits. This format should include all the necessary information such as the driver's name, date of birth, nationality, driving license number, and the types of vehicles they are allowed to drive. 

2. **Implement Blockchain Technology**: The next step would be to implement blockchain technology. Each driving permit would be a block in the blockchain. This would ensure the security and immutability of the data. 

3. **Global Acceptance**: For the Onchain Driving Permits to be accepted worldwide, there needs to be a global consensus. This could be achieved by getting the approval of international driving authorities and governments. 

4. **Create a Verification System**: A verification system needs to be created where authorities can easily verify the authenticity of the Onchain Driving Permits. This could be done through a public key infrastructure where each permit has a public key that can be used for verification.

5. **Update System**: An update system needs to be in place for when a driver's permit needs to be renewed or if there are any changes to the driver's information.

6. **Education and Training**: Lastly, there needs to be education and training for both the drivers and the authorities on how to use the Onchain Driving Permits.

By following these steps, we can turn [[Onchain Driving Permits]] into a hyperstructure for worldwide driving permits.

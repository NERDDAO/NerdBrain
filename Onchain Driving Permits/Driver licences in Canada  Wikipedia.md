Canadian government issued driving permits

In [Canada](/wiki/Canada "Canada"), [driver's licences](/wiki/Driver%27s_licence "Driver's licence") are issued by the government of the [province or territory](/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada "Provinces and territories of Canada") in which the driver is residing. Thus, specific regulations relating to driver's licences vary province to province, though overall they are quite similar. All provinces have provisions allowing non-residents to use licences issued by other provinces and territories, out-of-country licences, and [International Driving Permits](/wiki/International_Driving_Permit "International Driving Permit"). Many provinces also allow non-residents to use regular licences issued by other nations and countries. Canadian driver's licences are also valid in many other countries due to various international agreements and treaties.

## Age of eligibility
Canada's driving age is determined on a province-by-province basis. The age to begin driving varies by province, with the earliest being Alberta at 14 years of age.[[1]](#cite_note-1) The provinces use a [graduated driver licensing](/wiki/Graduated_driver_licensing "Graduated driver licensing") (GDL) system for a standard car and light-truck licence to ensure the proficiency of drivers.

The driving age in the various Canadian provinces is as follows:

## Standard data field labelling

Except for Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and DND 404 licences, each data field on the licence is labelled with a number. The field labels follow ISO/IEC 18013-1:2018, which extends the [labels for EU driving licences specified in Directive 2006/126/EC](/wiki/European_driving_licence#Standard_data_field_labelling "European driving licence").

## Provinces

### Alberta[]

- Class 7 (Learner): This permit can be obtained at 14 years of age, and can only be used when a non-probationary licensed driver (Class 5 or above; see below) over the age of 18 accompanies the driver. The fully licensed driver must be sitting in the front passenger seat. A computerized knowledge test requiring a mark of at least 83.3% as well as a vision test must be passed to obtain this licence. Restrictions on the Class 7 licence include zero [blood alcohol content](/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content "Blood alcohol content") while driving and the inability to drive between midnight and 5 am. Class 7 drivers may operate mopeds without an accompanying driver. A consent form must be signed by a parent or guardian for an applicant under the age of 18.
- Class 6 (Motorcycle): This permit allows an operator to drive a motorcycle without a supervising rider. The minimum age to obtain this licence is 16. A Class 7 licence must have been held for one year before it is possible to apply for a Class 6 licence. A learner holding a Class 7 licence must not drive a motorcycle during the night (defined as one hour after sunset, until 5 am or one hour before sunrise, whichever is later). Learners with a Class 7 or Class 5 Probationary licence may not operate (or sit on) a motorcycle with a blood alcohol content greater than zero. Learners with a Class 5 (non-probationary) or higher licence (Class 1, 2, 3, or 4) have no restrictions except that a supervising rider must be present.
- Class 5-GDL (Probationary): This licence can be obtained once a driver has held a Class 7 licence (Learner's Permit) for at least one year without suspension. In addition, the driver must be 16 years of age before he or she may apply for this licence. This licence allows one to drive without an accompanying fully licensed driver. However, this licence has more restrictions than a non-probationary licence. Fewer [demerit points](/wiki/Point_system_(driving) "Point system (driving)") are allowed and drivers must have zero blood alcohol content while driving. A probationary licence does not qualify the licence-holder to serve as an accompanying driver for a Class 7 driver. A basic road test is required to obtain this licence.
- Class 5 (Full, Non-GDL Driver's Licence): This licence can be obtained after having held the Class 5 Probationary licence for two years without suspension. The minimum age to obtain this licence is 18. An advanced road test is no longer required as of April 1, 2023 to obtain this licence. A driver automatically is eligible for the Class 5 licence so long as they have no demerits or suspensions in the last year preceding their eligibility. If the driver has demerits or suspensions, they must wait another year before becoming eligible for their Class 5 licence. A driver with this licence is referred to as a "fully licensed driver".
- Class 4: This permit allows the operator to drive a taxi, ambulance, or bus with seats for up to 24 passengers.
- Class 3: This permit allows an operator to drive a motor vehicle with 3 or more axles, or a motor vehicle with 3 or more axles pulling a trailer with one or more axles (assuming the trailer does not have air brakes).
- Class 2: This permit allows an operator to operate any bus, in addition to the vehicles permitted by holders of Class 3/4/5 licences.
- Class 1: This permit allows an operator to operate any motor vehicle except a motorcycle (as motorcycles always require the Class 6 licence specifically).

Drivers upgrading to a Class 1, 2, 3, or 4 licence must possess a Class 5 (non-probationary) licence and be at least 18 years of age to apply.[[2]](#cite_note-2)

#### Endorsement

- Air brakes: Air brake endorsements are required for any driver of a vehicle with an air-only braking system or a combination air and hydraulic braking system.[[3]](#cite_note-3) Any driver in Alberta may obtain an air brake endorsement after completing an approved air brake course, which includes a practical exam, and writing the written knowledge test at the registry. On all classes, except Class 1, the endorsement is represented as a "Q" on the licence. It is not shown on the Class 1 licence because all Class 1 drivers licensed in Alberta are required to have attended an approved air brake course; a Class 1 operator's licence cannot be obtained without it. The written knowledge test for Class 1 can be taken prior to having attended an air brake course; however, driver training can not commence until after the course is completed.
- Transportation of dangerous goods: TDG is not an endorsement placed on an operator licence, but rather is required training received generally from the employer for anyone who offers for transport, transports, or handles dangerous goods. Both employees and self-employed persons must have a dangerous goods training certificate to transport dangerous goods. It is employer-offered due to the wide variety of dangerous goods that may be transported, so the training is employer and commodity specific.

### British Columbia

- Class 8L (Motorcycle Learner's Permit): This permit can be first obtained at age 16, just as the Class 7L. There are many restrictions until the rider passes a "Motorcycle Skills Test", which is conducted on a parking lot and involves basic manoeuvring skills. After this test, the rider can ride alone, with much fewer restrictions.
- Class 7L (Learner's Permit): This permit can first be obtained at age 16, and requires a person under the age of 19 to obtain consent from a parent or legal guardian. To obtain this permit, one must take a knowledge test, which requires 80% to pass. A person holding this licence must be accompanied by a fully licensed driver over 25. They may have one additional passenger besides the supervisor. The driver must maintain a blood-alcohol count of zero (i.e. none in their blood), display a large 'L' decal on the back of their vehicle, have no more than two passengers (including the supervisor), and must not drive between 12AM and 5AM. Use of electronic devices is prohibited. The 7L licence is good for two years. After 12 months, the driver may take a 35-minute driving test to advance to the next level.
- Class 7 (Novice Licence), also called the "N" stage: This permit may be obtained once a driver is 17, after successful completion of the Class 7L driving test. A Class 7N licence is good for five years, and the stage takes a minimum of two years to complete (unless the person graduates from an accredited driving course, which reduces the length of time required to 18 months). Drivers must display a large 'N' decal on the back of their vehicle. Restrictions include 0 blood alcohol and a limit of one passenger (the limit being waived for anyone in the immediate family, and entirely if a supervisor over the age of 25 with a valid Class 5 (or above) licence is present.[[4]](#cite_note-4)) Any infraction of the traffic law by the possessor of a Class 7 licence can result in a prohibition, after which the possessor must begin the Class 7N program from the start. After two years with the Class 7N, the licence-holder may take the 45-minute Class 5 road test. Successful completion of this test grants a Class 5 passenger vehicle licence.
- Class 6 (Motorcycle Licence): This licence allows the holder to operate a motorcycle with no restrictions.
- Class 5 (Full Vehicle Licence): This is a full passenger-vehicle licence. It has no additional restrictions, unlike the Class 7 licences.
- Class 4 (Commercial) restricted: Permits the holder to operate taxis, limousines, ambulances, special buses used to transport people with disabilities and other special vehicles—also permits the holder to operate vehicles in Class 5. Minimum age to obtain is 19.
- Class 4 (Commercial) unrestricted: In addition to the vehicles listed for Class 4 restricted above, this permits the holder to operate buses with a maximum seating capacity of 25, including the driver.
- Class 3 (Commercial, heavy trucks): Permits the holder to operate trucks with more than two axles, including dump trucks and large tow trucks — also permits the holder to operate vehicles in Class 5. Minimum age to obtain is 18.
- Class 2 (Commercial, buses): Permits the holder to operate buses, including school buses, special activity buses, and special vehicles — also permits the holder to operate vehicles in Classes 4 and 5. Minimum age to obtain is 19.
- Class 1 (Commercial, semi-trailer): Permits the holder to operate semi-trailer trucks — also permits the holder to operate all motor vehicles or combinations of vehicles except motorcycles. Minimum age to obtain is 19.[[5]](#cite_note-5)

British Columbia has been using a GDL system since August 1998.[[6]](#cite_note-trafficinjuryresearch.com-6) The program was last revised in October 2003, which involved large changes to the time it took to acquire a full licence (previously, a person could complete the Class 7L stage in as little as 3 months, and the Class 7N in 12, and no passenger limit was enforced above Class 7L). British Columbia requires all new resident drivers to take a driving knowledge test and a road test in order to get a BC driver's licence, except for people holding a valid driver's licence from other Canadian jurisdictions, Austria, Australia, France, Germany, Guernsey, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, or the United States.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

### New Brunswick

In 2017, all four Atlantic provinces (including New Brunswick[[10]](#cite_note-10)) updated the driver's licence design to use a numbering scheme that resembles the [European driving licence](/wiki/European_driving_licence "European driving licence").[[11]](#cite_note-11)

### Newfoundland and Labrador

In Newfoundland and Labrador, one can apply for a learner's licence for Class 5 vehicles (passenger car or light truck) at the age of 16 and cannot obtain their licence until turning 17 (unless one is a graduate of a government-approved driving school program), as well as Class 6 vehicles (motorcycles).[[13]](#cite_note-gs.gov.nl.ca-13) Upon completion and pass of a written knowledge test and a vision test, a Class 5 Level I licence will be issued. This licence, commonly referred to as a "learner's permit" restricts holders to one passenger in the vehicle who must be a licensee of no less than 4 years, a blood alcohol level of 0% and no driving between 12am and 5am. A "novice driver" sign must also be placed on the rear windshield. Parental consent is required for applicants under the age of 19.[[14]](#cite_note-14)

After 12 months in Level I, or 8 months with the completion of a government-approved driving school program containing both classroom and in-car training, a road test can be taken to advance to Level II. Upon successful completion of the road test, one is advanced to Level II of the graduated licensing program. Level II lasts for 12 months and carries less restrictions than the initial stage. Passengers are permitted during the day but between 12am and 5am, the Level II driver must be accompanied by a licensed driver with 4 years driving experience and cannot have any other passengers in the vehicle. The drivers' blood alcohol content must remain at 0% in this stage.

After 12 months in Level II, the driver is automatically advanced to a full Class 5 licence (unless their licence was suspended in the learner's stage).

Newfoundland and Labrador uses a demerit point system. In two years, a driver can accumulate a maximum of 12 points, although in the novice stage, a maximum of 6 points can be accumulated.[[15]](#cite_note-15)

The classes in Newfoundland and Labrador are as follows:[[13]](#cite_note-gs.gov.nl.ca-13)

- Class 1 – permitted to operate semi-trailer trucks
- Class 2 – permitted to operate buses over 24 passengers
- Class 3 – permitted to operate trucks with 3 or more axles
- Class 4 – permitted to operate taxis, ambulances, all Class 5 motor vehicles and buses up to 24 passengers

Buses, taxis and ambulances while not carrying passengers, self propelled motor homes with 2 or more axles, farm tractors, fork lifts and emergency vehicles excluding ambulances, trucks designed for off highway use and vehicles commonly known as backhoes. A minimum of 1 year with a class 5 licence is required before one can apply for a commercial class licence.
- Class 6 – permitted to operate motorcycles
- Class 7 (phased out) – former learner stage of classes 5, 6 and 8
- Class 8 – permitted to operate traction engine vehicles[[16]](#cite_note-16)

### Nova Scotia

- Age: one must be at least 16 years old, with the passing of a multiple choice road theory test and an eye vision test, a driving permit is issued which allows the learning driver to drive on roads accompanied by someone with full valid driver's licence whose [blood alcohol content](/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content "Blood alcohol content") (BAC) is less than 0.05[[17]](#cite_note-17)

The classes in Nova Scotia are as follows:[[18]](#cite_note-18)

- Class 1 – semi-trailers and tractor-trailer combinations
- Class 2 – large buses seating more than 24 passengers
- Class 3 – vehicles or vehicle-trailer combinations weighing more than 14,000 kilograms
- Class 4 – smaller buses, vans seating fewer than 24 passengers for compensation, taxis, and ambulances

- Class 6 – motorcycles and motor-driven cycles
- Class 7 – learner's licence for people learning to drive class 5 vehicles
- Class 8 – farm tractors

For Class 7 or 8 licences, the Learner's stage of the system lasts for twelve months, which may be reduced to nine months if a recognized driver education or training program is taken.[[19]](#cite_note-19)

### Ontario

#### Graduated Licensing System for Passenger Vehicles[]

- [Learner's permit](/wiki/Learner%27s_permit "Learner's permit") (G1): Available at the age of 16 with successful completion of a multiple-choice road theory test and an eye vision test. The G1 licence allows the learning driver to drive on roads accompanied by a full G licence driver with four years of driving experience whose [blood alcohol content](/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content "Blood alcohol content") (BAC) is less than 0.05. Proof of four years' experience is indicated on a licence with four dots. The driver must not drive between 12 AM and 5 AM, and must not drive with a BAC above zero. Furthermore, a G1 driver may not drive on any of the following unless accompanied by a licensed instructor:
    1. [400-series highways](/wiki/400-series_highways "400-series highways") with posted speeds of over 80 km/h.
    2. [Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW)](/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_Way "Queen Elizabeth Way")
    3. [Don Valley Parkway](/wiki/Don_Valley_Parkway "Don Valley Parkway")
    4. [Gardiner Expressway](/wiki/Gardiner_Expressway "Gardiner Expressway") in the Greater Toronto Area
    5. [E.C. Row Expressway](/wiki/E._C._Row_Expressway "E. C. Row Expressway") in Windsor
    6. [Conestoga Parkway](/wiki/Conestoga_Parkway "Conestoga Parkway") in Kitchener-Waterloo
- Probationary licence (G2): Available after having held a G1 licence for 1 year, or eight months if the driver has graduated from a ministry-approved driver education course. After successfully completing a basic road test, a G2 driver may drive without an accompanying driver at any time and on all Ontario roads and highways. The driver must still maintain a BAC of zero and restrict passengers to the number of working seatbelts. As of September 2005, teenage drivers with a G2 licence are restricted in the number of passengers under 19 that they can carry at night.[[20]](#cite_note-20) Like the G1 licence, the G2 licence cannot be renewed, forcing progression towards a G licence.[[21]](#cite_note-21)
- Full licence (G): After 1 year of driving with a G2 licence, a driver must take an additional road test that includes driving on a highway. With successful completion, they will obtain a full licence, which carries no restrictions. No further tests are required until the age of 80, provided they renew their licence every five years.[[22]](#cite_note-ontariolicenses_renewals-22) Drivers 21 and under must still have a BAC of zero, even with a full G licence. Drivers aged 22 and over are permitted to drive with a maximum of 0.08 BAC, though roadside suspensions may be enforced above 0.05 BAC. Drivers 80 and over must complete a vision and knowledge test and participate in a 90-minute group education session to renew their licence, every two years.

#### Graduated Licensing System for Motorcycles[]

- Class M1: Motorcycles, including a limited-speed motorcycle (motor scooter) and a motor-assisted bicycle (moped). Level 1 of graduated licensing. Holders may drive a motorcycle under certain conditions, which are: blood alcohol content (BAC) must be zero, riders can only ride during daylight hours (half an hour before sunrise to half an hour after sunset), cannot ride on any highway with speeds of greater than 80 km/h except Highways 11, 17, 61, 69, 71, 101, 102, 144 and 655 and no passengers. The M1 allows drivers to drive alone, unlike G1 (which requires an eligible person accompanying). Cannot be renewed.
- Class M2: Motorcycles, including a limited-speed motorcycle (motor scooter) and a motor-assisted bicycle (moped). Level 2 of graduated licensing. Holders may drive a motorcycle but only with a zero blood alcohol level. Holders may also drive a Class G vehicle under the conditions that apply to a class G1 licence holder. Cannot be renewed.
- Class M2 with Condition L: Limited-speed motorcycle (LSM) or moped only. Holders may also drive a Class G vehicle under the conditions that apply to a Class G1 licence holder. Cannot be renewed.
- Class M2 with Condition M: Three-wheeled motorcycles only. Holders may also drive a Class G vehicle under the conditions that apply to a Class G1 licence holder.
- Class M: Motorcycles, including a limited-speed motorcycle (motor scooter) and a motor-assisted bicycle (moped). Holders may also drive a Class G vehicle under the conditions that apply to a class G1 licence holder
- Class M with Condition L: Limited-speed motorcycle (LSM) or mopeds only. Limited-speed motorcycles are motorcycles with a maximum speed of 70 km/h. If manufactured after 1988 they are identified by a label on the vehicle that indicates it to be a "LSM/MVL". Holders may also drive a Class G vehicle under the conditions that apply to a Class G1 licence holder.
- Class M with Condition M: Three-wheeled motorcycles only. Holders may also drive a Class G vehicle under the conditions that apply to a Class G1 licence holder.

#### Additional Licensing Types for Ontario[

#### Licensing restrictions/endorsements]

All licences in Ontario can carry any of the following restrictions/endorsements excluding some which are vehicle class specific. Some are related to health or to law enforcement penalty.

- Condition A: Special hand controls required
- Condition B: Special foot controls required
- Condition C: Special controls for hand and foot required
- Condition D: Hearing device required
- Condition E: Visual device required
- Condition F: Driver training conditions
- Condition G: Restricted class

Ontario has used a graduated licensing system since 1994. A driver can take as little as 20 months to get a full licence; however, a driver must have a full (G) licence within five years of obtaining a learner's permit (G1).

In 2006, Ontario passed legislation that would allow a court to suspend the licence of high school dropout until they turn 18. The act did not receive [royal assent](/wiki/Royal_assent "Royal assent") until December 2009, but is now in effect.[[24]](#cite_note-24)[[25]](#cite_note-25)

Traffic violation convictions usually come with [demerit points](/wiki/Demerit_point "Demerit point") against a person's licence. While the demerit points have no official impact on insurance rates, most insurance providers will increase the rate charged to a driver in response to demerit points. The demerit points are used by the Ministry of Transportation to determine licence suspensions due to repeated traffic violations (effects on Ontario insurance rates and eligibility are typically measured by the number of tickets received in recent years, rather than the associated points).

Drivers from out of province must obtain an Ontario driver's licence if staying more than 90 days. New residents of Ontario may only apply after residing in the province for 60 days.

Starting June 2009, Ontario began issuing enhanced drivers licences (EDLs) as an option to residents upon request. These licence while almost visually identical to regular drivers licences contained two distinct differences. The first being a machine readable code printed on the back of the card (visually similar to the same coding on a [Canadian passport](/wiki/Canadian_passport "Canadian passport")). The second: an embedded [RFID](/wiki/RFID "RFID") microchip. These changes were made in response to the heightened security precautions at US land border crossings. The changes allowed for quicker procedures at a border crossing as well as a cheaper alternative to a passport ($40 vs. $100).[[26]](#cite_note-26)

The enhanced driver's licence program has been discontinued.[[27]](#cite_note-27)

### Prince Edward Island[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driver%27s_licences_in_Canada&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Prince Edward Island")]

## Licence suspensions and revocations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driver%27s_licences_in_Canada&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Licence suspensions and revocations")]

Although licence suspensions and revocations are generally a matter for the territorial and provincial government departments of motor vehicles, some driving offences (e.g. [dangerous driving](/wiki/Dangerous_driving "Dangerous driving") and [impaired driving](/wiki/Impaired_driving "Impaired driving")) are criminal offences, set down in Canada's [Criminal Code](/wiki/Criminal_Code_(Canada) "Criminal Code (Canada)"). Prison sentences are often given to repeat offenders and to drivers convicted of causing death or [grievous bodily harm](/wiki/Grievous_bodily_harm "Grievous bodily harm") via Criminal Code driving offences.

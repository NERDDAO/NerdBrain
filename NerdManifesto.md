# NERD

What is NERD? As stated in our onChain charter we are a post-work collective exploring the Metaverse.  But what does being a post-work collective exploring the metaverse even mean? 

If you happen to be out of a job and reading this, you can now tell your friends that you're a post-work individual exploring the Metaverse.... haha..ha... is anyone looking for a content writer? I digress. Lets try to explain. 

We are currently on a transitional period where a series of new concepts are entering the mainstream at the same time. In order for our exploration to get anywhere we need to first make sense of what the implications of all these new superpowers we've unlocked could even be. 

There's two main things that make that word salad I just threw at you; Who we are: A Post-Work Collective, and what we do: Explore the Metaverse. Lets examine each in detail.

1) Who we are: Post-work collective

I believe that our current supply chain of knowledge is fundamentally flawed. Traditional systems aren't sufficiently capable of handling the data throughput of current times, and that traditional structures are limiting our capacity to connect between human beings in favor of corporate interests. The vast majority of these issues, in my opinion, come down to one critical collective misconception. For some reason we all seem to have had unconsciously agreed on the following statement: 

### Working, playing and learning are mutually exclusive activities. 

What I mean by that is that we seem to think that we must go to school and learn so we can then get hired to work and earn enough in order to be able to play. eventually, someday, maybe.  

NERD is founded on the idea that the opposite is true:

### When done properly, work, play and learn are all the same thing: Research. 

And boy, we NERDs love research. 

How do you join the NERDs? If you already are telling your friends you're a post-work individual exploring the Metaverse, then you're already a NERD! As the kids would say, we're just fucking around with new ways to coordinate and finding out what works and what doesn't. 

Nerds have never been about being IN groups so we don't have membership schemes. We only create utilities (No, governance is not an utility!). WE WILL NEVER ASK FOR FUNDS. You cannot work FOR NERD. NERD cannot work FOR you. NERD can work WITH you (We'll just call it research). We encourage you to capitalize in the tools and ideas we provide you and trust in you to play fair. 


2) What we do: Explore the Metaverse

NERDs take games very seriously. We operate with an expanded vision of the Metaverse that goes beyond either videogames or the blockchain. We see the Metaverse as the sum of all the interfaces an individual has access to with a single identity. We Research the Metaverse by interacting with different protocols, designing out project ideas and trying to implement them in production, which lead us to a deeper understanding of the Metaverse's inner workings.

The blockchain is a dark forest. Its best not to go alone.  We've found out by ourselves several times so you dont have to. We have created a trail of projects you can see here and a trove of knowledge we use to better navigate its depths. We regularly embark on new journeys of knowledge which everyone is invited to join and help out with. Every time our toolkit grows  the depth of our designs increases as it adapts more concepts as they are integrated as composable lego blocks to an already deep set of options create a fractal design space.

# Planned future iterations

As our CaaS becomes more widely trusted and used, the sophistication of the process will increase. Future iterations will include on-chain reputation systems for Contributors, embedded collaborations with other DeSci projects on initiatives such as decentralized publishing, peer reviewing, data storage and research outsourced to DeSciWorld by institutions and universities.
